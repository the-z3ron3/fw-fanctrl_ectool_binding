# GSoC 2025 Qualification Task for CCExtractor Development â€“ Python Bindings for ectool

This repository contains a **basic proof-of-concept C library** and **Python binding** designed for the [Google Summer of Code 2025](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) application with **CCExtractor**. The goal is to demonstrate understanding of how to expose C functions to Python and integrate them into an existing project - in this case, `fw-fanctrl`.

## Objective

Create a minimal shared C library that:
- Exposes simple functions returning a constant value.
- Is callable from Python using `ctypes`.
- Is integrated into a modified version of `fw-fanctrl`.

This serves as the **qualification task** for the GSoC project: [Create Python bindings for ectool](https://ccextractor.org/public/gsoc/2025/fw-fanctrl/).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/the-z3ron3/fw-fanctrl_ectool_binding
```

2. Install fw-fanctrl.
```
./install.sh
```

3. Go into ```libectool``` folder.
```
cd fw-fanctrl_ectool_binding/libectool
```

4. Execute ```build.sh``` shell script.
```
./build.sh
```
It will compile ```ectool.c```, ```ectool.h``` and generate ```libectool.so``` file. The shared object file will also be copied into the root repository folder (fw-fanctrl_ectool_binding) so no need to manually copy it.

5. Run fw-fanctrl.
```
fw-fanctrl run
```

You can see in above screenshot that fw-fanctrl is fetching temperature values from the dummy shared library file instead of ectool which is the proof of concept for this task.
